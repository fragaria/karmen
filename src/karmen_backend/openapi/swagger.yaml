        Post to this endpoint to add a printer. In CLOUD_MODE, you can add printer by token.
        In non-CLOUD mode, printer addition requires specifying the network address (IP or hostname).
        Now, we only specify printer_by_network_props, and printer_by_token is commented. This is because
        of a bug in connexion https://github.com/zalando/connexion/issues/691 because of which oneOf doesn't work
